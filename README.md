# Building Applications with React 17 and ASP.NET Core 6

This repository has the source-code that I used during the study of the course **Building Applications with React 17 and ASP.NET Core 6**.

### Description :rocket:
------------------------
Use React, Hooks, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap, Leaflet and JWT to create a complete web application.

### How to run :rocket:
------------------------
- Use Visual Code to open both folders in each module.
- For the MoviesAPI, execute a build and run (apply any change that VS Code recommends).
- For the react-movies, open a terminal and execute *npm start*.
	-> If you receive an error like 'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command, execute this command: *npm install react-scripts --save*.
